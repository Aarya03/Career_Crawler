# Career_Crawler
Many small educational institutions in Patna and sub-urban Patna (Bihta).</br>
Here, we only focus on the educational institutes. They are in large number and can employ people of different qualifications.</br>
Most of them operate a simple website with no standard sitemap/site structure.</br>
Most of the job related sites or even search engines donâ€™t put them in their top results.</br>

WE AIM TO FIND SUCH OBSCURE INSTITUTES TO PRESENT MORE JOB PROSPECTS AND SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO THE UNEMPLOYED AND THE INSTITUTES RESPECTIVELY.</br>
