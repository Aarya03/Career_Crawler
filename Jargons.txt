ANDROID

Appcomatactivty
-> androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity. Base class for activities that wish to use some of the newer platform features on older Android devices. Some of these backported features include: Using the action bar, including action items, navigation modes and more with the setSupportActionBar(Toolbar) API.

AsyncTask
-> Android AsyncTask is an abstract class provided by Android which gives us the liberty to perform heavy tasks in the background and keep the UI thread light thus making the application more responsive. Android application runs on a single thread when launched.

AsyncResponse
-> An injectable JAX-RS asynchronous response that provides means for asynchronous server side response processing.

doInBackground(Params) 
-> This method is invoked on the background thread immediately after onPreExecute() finishes its execution. Main purpose of this method is to perform the background operations that can take a long time. The parameters of the Asynchronous task are passed to this step for execution.

Intent
-> An Intent in the Android operating system is a software mechanism that allows users to coordinate the functions of different activities to achieve a task.

Adapter
-> Adapter is a bridge between UI and data source, It helps us to fill data in the UI components. Base Adapter is common base class of a general implementation of an Adapter.

Filterable
-> Android provides Filterable class to filter the data by a filter (condition). Usually the getFilter() method has to be overridden in the adapter class in which the filter condition is provided to search through a list.

View holder
-> A ViewHolder describes an item view and metadata about its place within the RecyclerView.

RecyclerView
-> RecyclerView is the ViewGroup that contains the views corresponding to your data. It's a view itself, so you add RecyclerView into your layout the way you would add any other UI element.

Layout
-> A layout defines the structure for a user interface in your app, such as in an activity. All elements in the layout are built using a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects. A View usually draws something the user can see and interact with.

StringRequest and Volley
-> At a high level, you use Volley by creating a RequestQueue and passing it Request objects. The RequestQueue manages worker threads for running the network operations, reading from and writing to the cache, and parsing responses. Requests do the parsing of raw responses and Volley takes care of dispatching the parsed response back to the main thread for delivery.

Shared preferences
-> Shared preferences allow you to store small amounts of primitive data as key/value pairs in a file on the device. To get a handle to a preference file, and to read, write, and manage preference data, use the SharedPreferences class. The Android framework manages the shared preferences file itself.
